# TiMBIM Website
Code InstituteUser Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

I made this website to present TiMBIM to a wider public by highlighting our strengts and projects already done by my collegues and I.

## User Experience
I decided to go for a simple not to cluttered design with on small screen no background and on medium and big screens a nice background related to our work. The background picture is by Barun Patro from https://freeimages.com/ from FreeImages.

Clients can see which kind of projects we already did, what kind of services we offer and contact one of us via the contact page.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (4.3.1)

## Features to be implemented in future
In future I would like to showcase some tools made for different BIM platforms.

## Content
All content is written by me.
Hereby the general design for the pages. I decided to devide the information in columns which turn into rows on smaller devices.

### **Layout with 2 columns**
